# SOC Incident Reports (Portfolio)

This repository documents hands-on SOC-style investigations and incident write-ups focused on:
- Phishing email triage and analysis
- Log correlation (proxy/firewall/authentication)
- Severity assessment and escalation decisions
- Practical remediation recommendations

## Structure
- `phishing-incidents/` — phishing case write-ups (email + URL investigation, user-impact checks)

## Notes
- Reports are written in a SOC-appropriate format and avoid sharing platform-specific answers, flags, or proprietary content.
- The goal is to demonstrate investigation methodology and defensive reasoning aligned with junior SOC responsibilities.
